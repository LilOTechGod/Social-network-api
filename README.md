# Social-network-api
### An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts

## User Story:

*As I dive deeper into the backend side of web development. I discovered the amazing wonders of NoSQL. There's many advantages when it comes to using a NoSQL databse like it's affordability and impressive ability to scale so well. Because of It's popularity I had to educate myself and learn the basics of NoSQL. This challenge consisted of me making an API for a social network using a NoSQL databse so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.*

Bown below I wil be demonstrating it's functionality use insomnia as my front end. Check it out!
